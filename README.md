# Epitope Immunogenicity Prediction using Machine Learning
<hr>


**Overview**<br>
*This project focuses on predicting epitope immunogenicity using supervised machine learning algorithms. A carefully cleaned and engineered biological dataset was used to evaluate the ability of different classifiers to distinguish immunogenic vs non-immunogenic epitopes.*

**Machine Learning Models**<br>
*The following classifiers were trained and evaluated using an 80:20 train–test split:*
`Logistic Regression`
`Random Forest Classifier`
`Support Vector Classifier (SVC)`
`Decision Tree Classifier`
`K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)`

**Model Evaluation**<br>
*Each model was evaluated using:*
`Accuracy`
`Precision`
`Recall`
`Confusion Matrix`
`ROC Curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC)`
ROC curves for all models were plotted on a single graph to enable direct comparison of discriminative performance.
