# Epitope Immunogenicity Prediction using Machine Learning
<hr>


**Overview**
*This project focuses on predicting epitope immunogenicity using supervised machine learning algorithms. A carefully cleaned and engineered biological dataset was used to evaluate the ability of different classifiers to distinguish immunogenic vs non-immunogenic epitopes.*
